# Bug Fixes and Chill: YouTube Series Examples and Practice Code

Welcome to the practice code and examples from my YouTube video series, [Bug Fixes and Chill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUu2DhK7dQWO1yyI-tbga6luHWIs3hwSE). Here, you'll find a breakdown of each episode along with the corresponding video link and example app.

Most of the debugging tools we discuss are much harder to use on a production app as the code is compiled and pretty much unreadable, I suggest you clone the app locally and then play around with it.
